UAV is an aerial vehicle that does not carry a human operator, uses aerodynamic forces to provide vehicle lift, can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, can be expandable or recoverable, and can carry a lethal or nonlethal payload. It is controlled either autonomously by onboard computers or by remote control of a pilot on the ground.
